\section{Language Models Services}\label{sec:ref}
In this section we will comment on the specific problems of deploying LLMs in the Pocket Network. As we have seen before, the LLMs are generative models and as such they are inherently difficult to measure. On top of this difficulty, there is the popularity of LLMs that leads to an explosion in open models from where to choose and the variations of these models that are released at an unprecedented pace. We will try to explain this difficulties as simple as possible, and lay out some concepts that will guide other iterations of this group.

\subsection{Same-Model Variations}
- why we cannot fix llms models
- why we cant trust labels

\subsection{The Black Box Problem}
- how to divide them in services
- how to meassure them
