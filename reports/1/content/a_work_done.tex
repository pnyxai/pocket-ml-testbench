\section{Progress Overview}\label{sec:ref}

During the month of March, the socket achieved the following milestones:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Released a Local-Net proof of concept for the Pocket Network (Morse). The Local-Net features two Machine Learning (ML) services: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models (image generation).
    \item Updated \emph{pocket-core} and \emph{pocket-localnet} repos (POKTscan forks) to support ML relays:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The default mesh config timed-out on ml calls (both LLMs and Diffusers).
        \item The pocket core had a limit of 1MB incoming RPC sizes, a parameter was added to make this configurable and enforced in a more modular fashion.
        \item The relayer app of \emph{pocket-localnet} was updated to allow response dumping and custom relays (this will only be used for the proof of concept).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Released guides to deploy ML models:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Large Language Models using vLLM backend and OpenAI API compatibility.
        \item Diffusers using a custom backend that looks to be like Stable Diffusion API (needs more work).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Started work on benchmarking process:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conceptual designed settled.
        \item Started to work on \emph{lm-eval-harness} implementation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
