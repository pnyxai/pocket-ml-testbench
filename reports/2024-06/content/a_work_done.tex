            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In June 2024, significant progress was made on the socket, culminating in the completion of various tasks and milestones. 
Finally the different components of the \gls{MLTB}, such as the Manager, Sampler, Evaluator, and Sidecard were integrated. 
This integration culminated presenting the leaderboards on a website considering the results of the corresponding task metrics.

In the next sections of the present report the details of these developments and their implications are presented. 
These sections provide an overview of the work completed, updating components initially considered, and the progress made towards the final goal of the socket.

Furthermore, looking ahead, there are several future work ideas to consider. 
These include refining the evaluation metrics further, exploring additional benchmark for extended functionalities. 
These future initiatives aim to enhance the network capacity guided by the state-of-the-art in the field of machine learning and blockchain technology.
