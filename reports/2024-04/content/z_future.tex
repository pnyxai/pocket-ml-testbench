\section{Future Work}\label{sec:z}

This moth we focused of building the \gls{MLTB} code, we defined the main architecture and built the basic code around it. 
We expect to continue building this code during the next month and be able to produce the first tests on a local network.
In order to do so we will have to complete the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Finish the \emph{Manager} code: Most work to be done is buffer handling. We do not expect to implement elaborated sampling strategies at this pint.
    \item Finish the \emph{Sampler} code: Task is advanced we need to finish and test the correct writing of the MongoDB collections.
    \item Finish the \emph{Requester} code: Almost complete, working on error handling and test code.
    \item Begin and Finish the \emph{Evaluator} code.
    \item Create code for proof of concept deployment on local net.
\end{enumerate}

One of the tasks that we worked during the month of April was the \emph{POKT Square RAG Agent}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/pokt-scan/pokt-square}}. We will not be performing active development of this product during May due to time and human resources constraints. Nevertheless we will be responsive and provide feedback to any team that wishes to pick up the project in the meantime.
