# Development Files

This folder contains the Docker compose files to deploy the test bench.
We provide two sets of files, please refer to them for instructions:
- [Developer Environment](./dev/README.md) : What is used for local development, services are separated so you can control what to deploy and how.
- [Morse Proof of Concept](./morse-poc/README.md) : A one-command (hopefully) deployment to test everything.
