# Machine Learning Models Deployment

This folder contains helper code used for deployment of ML models into the Pocket Network.
While we provide these as examples, we welcome additions to enlarge this collection. The Pocket Network does not restrict how models are deployed, but enforces API compatibility, by having a centralized code base for model deployment we expect to help node operators to quickly provide the best possible service.

The current examples cover:

### Diffusion Models
- [Custom Diffusers API](./diffusers): A custom API to deploy diffusers models.

### Language Models
- [vLLM - GPU](./llm): Configuration files to deploy a LLM using vLLM and GPU as backend.
